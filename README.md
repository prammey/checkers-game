Red must go first.

To make a move, click a piece and click on the box the player wants it to go to. If there is an opportunity for a player to jump and take an opponent's piece, the game forces them to take it. If a player's piece makes it to the other side of the board, there will be a '*' on the piece to show it is now a king.
